<br><br>
Round 2: SWAPBRO 
Well after round 1 here's second test of your friendship.
In this round one member will code for half time and and then members swap with each other.Now other member have to predict what is code doing and write rest of the code .......looks great.
Well see you on the arena of friendship?

                        <p>This is an event with an aim to construct an  robot (wired or wireless) which can successfully pass through each of the hurdle in a specified order. The teams will compete on completing the course in the fastest time possible and rack up the most points which are awarded on each successful hurdle pass.<br>
<br>
<h3>CHALLENGE:</h3>
“Manoeuvre your bots till the finish line in the fastest time”
Design a manually controlled ROBOT that has the capacity to cover maximum distance in shortest possible time, challenging the hurdles and be one of the best opponents. Think your robot can overcome any obstacle-big or small in the least of time. If so get it on the track and let the game begin. And bear in mind that maximizing RPM does not make you winner but winners are those who have good presence of mind, sharpness and practice.

                            different points. One robot is assigned to each team and the position of each ball at the end
                            of the game governs the final score and hence the winner.
